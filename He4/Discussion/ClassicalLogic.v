(** * Classical Logic

    I'm hesitant to use classical logic until I am convinced that
    classical logic is absolutely necessary. By waiting, I hope to
    better understand exactly why classical logic is (or is not)
    required.

    I don't think classical logic would cause us any harm though, since
    we are not trying to extract executable code from our proofs. *)
